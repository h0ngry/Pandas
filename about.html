<span>About Endangered Animals:</span><br>
<p>  An endangered species is defined as a species that is at risk of extinction due ot a number of contributing causes. These causes include, but are not limited to, human activity, changes in climate, changes in food chain balance, and destruction of habitat. These species are likely to die out if conservation efforts fail. </p>
<p>   Furthermore, there are over 40,000 species that are considered threatened. Threatened species are species that are likely to become endangered species in the near future due to declining numbers.</p>
<p>   The United States passed the Endangered Species Act in 1973 in efforts to protest these species. This act prohibits hunting of these species and limits the destruction of their habitat. Although this measure has been successful in preventing the extinction of several different species of animal, it is not a sufficient alone.</p>
<p>It is critical to preserve as many species as possible due to the impact on ecosystem. The extinction of a single species can cause the balance of it's ecosystem to collapse, negatively impacting hundreds or even thousands of other species. This can cause a domino effect of endangerment and extinction.</p>
<p>For these reasons, conservation efforts are critical. From breeding programs to habitat protection, there are a variety of ways people are protecting these endangered plants and animals that are critical for their protection. </p>
